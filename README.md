# Data has been fetched 
The data user will be able to see will be is a fetched data.
fetched data is stored in local state

- adding to album
    when we add data to album then the data won't be send to backend , it will only be store on local state.

- deleting
    when we delete the data gets deleted from the local state, but on deleting no data will be deleted from backend.



It's a simple project,  no as such work is done on css ,  as functioning was my main concern.
